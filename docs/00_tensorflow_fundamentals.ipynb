        "[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source end-to-end machine learning library for preprocessing data, modelling data and serving models (getting them into the hands of others).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why use TensorFlow?\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely you'll use a library such as TensorFlow. This is because it contains many of the most common machine learning functions you'll want to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What we're going to cover\n",
        "\n",
        "TensorFlow is vast. But the main premise is simple: turn data into numbers (tensors) and build machine learning algorithms to find patterns in them.\n",

        "* Introduction to tensors (creating tensors)\n",
        "* Getting information from tensors (tensor attributes)\n",
        "* Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)\n",

        "* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)\n",
        "* Using GPUs with TensorFlow\n",
        "* Exercises to try\n",
        "\n",
        "Things to note:\n",
        "* Many of the conventions here will happen automatically behind the scenes (when you build a model) but it's worth knowing so if you see any of these things, you know what's happening.\n",
        "* For any TensorFlow function you see, it's important to be able to check it out in the documentation, for example, going to the Python API docs for all functions and searching for what you need: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/ (don't worry if this seems overwhelming at first, with enough practice, you'll get used to navigating the documentaiton).\n",

        "\n",
