    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook ([transfer learning part 3: scaling up](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/06_transfer_learning_in_tensorflow_part_3_scaling_up.ipynb)) we built Food Vision mini: a transfer learning model which beat the original results of the [Food101 paper](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/) with only 10% of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** **Top-1 accuracy** means \"accuracy for the top softmax activation value output by the model\" (because softmax ouputs a value for every class, but top-1 means only the highest one is evaluated). **Top-5 accuracy** means \"accuracy for the top 5 softmax activation values output by the model\", in other words, did the true label appear in the top 5 activation values? Top-5 accuracy scores are usually noticeably higher than top-1.\n",

    "## Check GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we're going to be doing something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to be using mixed precision training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed precision training was introduced in [TensorFlow 2.4.0](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/12/whats-new-in-tensorflow-24.html) (a very new feature at the time of writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "What does **mixed precision training** do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed precision training uses a combination of single precision (float32) and half-preicison (float16) data types to speed up model training (up 3x on modern GPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about this more later on but in the meantime you can read the [TensorFlow documentation on mixed precision](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, before we can move forward if we want to use mixed precision training, we need to make sure the GPU powering our Google Colab instance (if you're using Google Colab) is compataible. \n",
    "\n",
    "For mixed precision training to work, you need access to a GPU with a compute compability score of 7.0+. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab offers P100, K80 and T4 GPUs, however, **the P100 and K80 aren't compatible with mixed precision training**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore before we proceed we need to make sure we have **access to a Tesla T4 GPU in our Google Colab instance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not using Google Colab, you can find a list of various [Nvidia GPU compute capabilities on Nvidia's developer website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** If you run the cell below and see a P100 or K80, try going to to Runtime -> Factory Reset Runtime (note: this will remove any saved variables and data from your Colab instance) and then retry to get a T4."

    "## Create preprocessing functions for our data\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous notebooks, when our images were in folder format we used the method [`tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/utils/image_dataset_from_directory) to load them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this meant our data was loaded into a format ready to be used with our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we've downloaded the data from TensorFlow Datasets, there are a couple of preprocessing steps we have to take before it's ready to model. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, our data is currently:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In `uint8` data type\n",
    "* Comprised of all differnet sized tensors (different sized images)\n",
    "* Not scaled (the pixel values are between 0 & 255)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, models like data to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In `float32` data type\n",
    "* Have all of the same size tensors (batches require all tensors have the same shape, e.g. `(224, 224, 3)`)\n",
    "* Scaled (values between 0 & 1), also called normalized\n",
    "\n",
    "To take care of these, we'll create a `preprocess_img()` function which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resizes an input image tensor to a specified size using [`tf.image.resize()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/resize)\n",
    "* Converts an input image tensor's current datatype to `tf.float32` using [`tf.cast()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/cast)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Note:** Pretrained EfficientNetBX models in [`tf.keras.applications.efficientnet`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/efficientnet) (what we're going to be using) have rescaling built-in. But for many other model architectures you'll want to rescale your data (e.g. get its values between 0 & 1). This could be incorporated inside your \"`preprocess_img()`\" function (like the one below) or within your model as a [`tf.keras.layers.Rescaling`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Rescaling) layer."

    "## Batch & prepare datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can model our data, we have to turn it into batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because computing on batches is memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We turn our data from 101,000 image tensors and labels (train and test combined) into batches of 32 image and label pairs, thus enabling it to fit into the memory of our GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this in effective way, we're going to be leveraging a number of methods from the [`tf.data` API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📖 **Resource:** For loading data in the most performant way possible, see the TensorFlow docuemntation on [Better performance with the tf.data API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we're going to be using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`map()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#map) - maps a predefined function to a target dataset (e.g. `preprocess_img()` to our image tensors)\n",
    "* [`shuffle()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#shuffle) - randomly shuffles the elements of a target dataset up `buffer_size` (ideally, the `buffer_size` is equal to the size of the dataset, however, this may have implications on memory)\n",
    "* [`batch()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#batch) - turns elements of a target dataset into batches (size defined by parameter `batch_size`)\n",
    "* [`prefetch()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#prefetch) - prepares subsequent batches of data whilst other batches of data are being computed on (improves data loading speed but costs memory)\n",
    "* Extra: [`cache()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#cache) - caches (saves them for later) elements in a target dataset, saving loading time (will only work if your dataset is small enough to fit in memory, standard Colab instances only have 12GB of memory) \n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "- Can't batch tensors of different shapes (e.g. different image sizes, need to reshape images first, hence our `preprocess_img()` function)\n",
    "- `shuffle()` keeps a buffer of the number you pass it images shuffled, ideally this number would be all of the samples in your training set, however, if your training set is large, this buffer might not fit in memory (a fairly large number like 1000 or 10000 is usually suffice for shuffling)\n",
    "- For methods with the `num_parallel_calls` parameter available (such as `map()`), setting it to`num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` will parallelize preprocessing and significantly improve speed\n",
    "- Can't use `cache()` unless your dataset can fit in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Woah, the above is alot. But once we've coded below, it'll start to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to through things in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original dataset (e.g. train_data) -> map() -> shuffle() -> batch() -> prefetch() -> PrefetchDataset\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like saying, \n",
    "\n",

Retrain the model (feature extraction and fine-tuning) we trained in this notebook, except this time use [`EfficientNetB4`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB4) as the base model instead of `EfficientNetB0`. Do you notice an improvement in performance? Does it take longer to train? Are there any tradeoffs to consider?\n",
