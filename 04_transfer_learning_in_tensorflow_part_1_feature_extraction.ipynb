        "\n",
        "We've built a bunch of convolutional neural networks from scratch and they all seem to be learning, however, there is still plenty of room for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve our model(s), we could spend a while trying different configurations, adding more layers, changing the learning rate, adjusting the number of neurons per layer and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, doing this is very time consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Luckily, there's a technique we can use to save time.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's called **transfer learning**, in other words, taking the patterns (also called weights) a model has learned from another problem and using them for our own problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
        "1. Can leverage an existing neural network architecture proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
        "2. Can leverage a working neural network architecture which has **already learned** patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data.\n",
        "\n",
        "What this means is, instead of hand-crafting our own neural network architectures or building them from scratch, we can utilise models which have worked for others.\n",
        "\n",
        "And instead of training our own models from scratch on our own datasets, we can take the patterns a model has learned from datasets such as [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (millions of images of different objects) and use them as the foundation of our own. Doing this often leads to getting great results with less data.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Introduce transfer learning (a way to beat all of our old self-built models)\n",
        "- Using a smaller dataset to experiment faster (10% of training samples of 10 classes of food)\n",
        "- Then go into:\n",
        "  - 10% of 100 classes with transfer learning (a big dawg model)\n",
        "- Ways to prevent overfitting/improve\n",
        "  - How to continue training a model from a certain point (e.g. how does a model train for more epochs after already training for 10 epochs)\n",
        "  - Data augmentation\n",
        "  - EarlyStopping\n",
        "  - Regularization (more images)\n",

        "You can read through the descriptions and the code (it should all run, except for the cells which error on purpose), but there's a better option.\n",

        "Write all of the code yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes. I'm serious. Create a new notebook, and rewrite each line by yourself. Investigate it, see if you can break it, why does it break?\n",

        "\n",
        "Since we're working with images, our target are the [models which perform best on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet).\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll probably find not all of the model architectures listed on paperswithcode appear on TensorFlow Hub. And this is okay, we can still use what's available.\n",

        "    * However, the tradeoff with larger numbers can mean they take longer to compute. \n",
        "7. Select EfficientNetB0 and you should see [something like the following](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=image-classification,image-feature-vector&network-architecture=efficientnet-b0&tf-version=tf2).\n",

        "\n",
        "  * For example, many computer vision models are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset which contains 1000 different classes of images. This means passing a single image to this model will produce 1000 different prediction probability values (1 for each class). \n",
        "\n",
        "    * This is helpful if you have 1000 classes of image you'd like to classify and they're all the same as the ImageNet classes, however, it's not helpful if you want to classify only a small subset of classes (such as 10 different kinds of food). Model's with `\"/classification\"` in their name on TensorFlow Hub provide this kind of functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature extraction transfer learning** is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) a pretrained model has learned and adjust its outputs to be more suited to your problem. \n",
        "\n",
        "  * For example, say the pretrained model you were using had 236 different layers (EfficientNetB0 has 236 layers), but the top layer outputs 1000 classes because it was pretrained on ImageNet. To adjust this to your own problem, you might remove the original activation layer and replace it with your own but with the right number of output classes. The important part here is that **only the top few layers become trainable, the rest remain frozen**. \n",
        "\n",
        "    * This way all the underlying patterns remain in the rest of the layers and you can utilise them for your own problem. This kind of transfer learning is very helpful when your data is similar to the data a model has been pretrained on.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fine-tuning transfer learning** is when you take the underlying patterns (also called weights) of a pretrained model and adjust them slightly to your own problem. \n",
        "\n",
        "    * This usually means training **some, many or all** of the layers in the pretrained model. This is useful when you've got a large dataset (e.g. 100+ images per class) where your data is slightly different to the data the original model was trained on.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common workflow is to \"freeze\" all of the learned patterns in the bottom layers of a pretrained model so they're untrainable. And then train the top 2-3 layers of so the pretrained model can adjust its outputs to your custom data (**feature extraction**).\n",
        "\n",
        "After you've trained the top 2-3 layers, you can then gradually \"unfreeze\" more and more layers and run the training process on your own data to further **fine-tune** the pretrained model.\n",

        "\n",
        "The lower a layer is in a computer vision model as in, the closer it is to the input layer, the larger the features it learn. For example, a bottom layer in a computer vision model to identify images of cats or dogs might learn the outline of legs, where as, layers closer to the output might learn the shape of teeth. Often, you'll want the larger features (learned patterns are also called features) to remain, since these are similar for both animals, where as, the differences remain in the more fine-grained features.\n",
